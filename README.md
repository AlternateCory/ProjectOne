Game Name: Zombie Slayer

Group: NiceDynamite: Cory Rooker, Blake Martin, Austin Abernathy, Jesse P

Cheat Codes: “Infinite Health” (CTRL + L) cheat and a “super fast shooting” (CTRL + G + Hold Left Mouse)

How to start: There is not an executable because I cannot build one so you must play by running it from GameMaker.

How to play: Control the character's movement by using the arrow keys and the mouse. Shoot by clicking the lift mouse button. Kill as many zombies as you can before you run out of health. Med packs spawn at random and after you clear a few levels there is a boss battle.
